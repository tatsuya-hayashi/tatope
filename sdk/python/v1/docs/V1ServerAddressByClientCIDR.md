# V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR

ServerAddressByClientCIDR helps the client to determine the server address that they should use, depending on the clientCIDR that they match.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**client_cidr** | **str** | The CIDR with which clients can match their IP to figure out the server address that they should use. | [default to '']
**server_address** | **str** | Address of this server, suitable for a client that matches the above CIDR. This can be a hostname, hostname:port, IP or IP:port. | [default to '']

## Example

```python
from tatope.models.v1_server_address_by_client_cidr import V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR from a JSON string
v1_server_address_by_client_cidr_instance = V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1_server_address_by_client_cidr_dict = v1_server_address_by_client_cidr_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR from a dict
v1_server_address_by_client_cidr_from_dict = V1ServerAddressByClientCIDR.from_dict(v1_server_address_by_client_cidr_dict)
